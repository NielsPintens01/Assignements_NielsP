# Assignments: production process + image manipulation

## Overview

This repository contains the following scripts:
- 2 Python scripts that analyze historical production data of two locations (Brussels and Copenhagen) stored in JSON files. It performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and simulation. 
- 1 Python script that performs various image manipulations, including copying, flipping, and creating composite images. 


## Dependencies

- Python 3.9
- Jupyter
- os
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- Pillow (PIL)

## Running the Script

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml

2. **Usage:**
   
   Once you have Jupyter installed, you can use the provided Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration and analysis.
   To start Jupyter, run the following command in your terminal: jupyter notebook --notebook-dir="C:\Users\niels\Documents\Assignements_NielsP"
   
3. **Follow Prompts:**

   Follow any prompts provided by the script, such as entering the number of days for simulation.

4. **Review Outputs:**

   - Review the generated plots and any printed statistics or results.
